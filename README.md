## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

*   **Curated Queries**: Pre-built KQL queries for common and advanced security scenarios.
*   **Threat Hunting Patterns**: Queries to identify suspicious activities, anomalies, and potential indicators of compromise.
*   **Operational Insights**: Dashboards and analytics queries for monitoring security posture and compliance.
*   **Reusable Templates**: Modular query structures that can be adapted for different environments.
